*"It is the supreme art of the teacher to awaken joy in creative expression and knowledge."*

Albert Einstein (1879–1955)

I have taught the following courses for undergraduate and graduate students.

**UNDERGRADUATE**

- Linear Algebra and Analytical Geometry
- Numerical Calculus
- Physics (Mechanics)
- Physics (Waves, Thermodynamics and Fluids)

**GRADUATE**

- Methodology for Scientific Reseach
- Scientific Writing
- Materiais Science
- Computational Modeling of Materials

**Physics Education**

I am also interested in Physics Education.
I believe that students interacting with real experiments and working 
with experimental data can achieve a better understanding of physical concepts.
“Hands-on” experiments, either using it or developing it, provide an interesting teaching and learning framework.
Therefore, I have worked on designing experiments and demonstrations based on recent technologies (e.g. Arduino) 
to be used in class to illustrate physical concepts. Here in the School of 
Technology/UNICAMP, the experiments/demonstrations are developed by undergraduate 
students using the Laboratory of Instrumentation for Teaching (LIE in Portuguese) 
facilities.
