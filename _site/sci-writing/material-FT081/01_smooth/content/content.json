This method is designed to investigate chemical compounds that have one or more unpaired electrons. When placing the sample in a magnetic field, its free electrons will align themselves either parallel or anti- parallel to the magnetic field. By firing electromagnetic waves at these electrons they can be switched from a negative spin state to a positive spin state. The g-factor of the compound (which describes how closely the unpaired electron\u2019s behaviour resembles a free electron) can be determined through this method. In this experiment the g-factor of the DPPH sample was determined as 1.85\u00b10.06. This is slightly lower than the actual value of 2.0036, but taking into account other errors and uncertainties encountered, it can be considered a valid result.<\/p>\n","<p>This experiment is about the use of electron spin resonance to work out the characteristics of a passive oscillator circuit and a DPPH sample. This is a method designed to find out about chemical compounds that has one or more unpaired electrons. When placing the sample in a magnetic field its free electrons will aline itself either parallel or anti-parallel to the magnetic field. By electromagnetic waves at these electrons one can hope to switch these from a negative spin to a positive spin. Through this method one can determine the so called g-factor of the compound (describes how close the unpaired electron behaves as a free electron ). Through doing this experiment we determined the g-factor of the DPPH sample as 1.85\u00b10.06.
