Why is there an umbrella on the cover of the book? The reason is that this was one of the more unusual methods of putting poison into someone. The victim was Georgi Markov, a Bulgarian dissident who had fled to London and whom the Bulgarian authorities wished to silence because every week he broadcast critical items about them on the propaganda station Radio Free Europe. Markov was stabbed surreptitiously with an airgun disguised as an umbrella when he was waiting for a bus near Waterloo Bridge on his way to work. This shot a poisoned pellet into his leg and three days later he was dead.  However, it took several weeks before it was discovered what had killed him.
