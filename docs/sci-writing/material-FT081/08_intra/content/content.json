University students going into business often think their secretaries will do their writing for them. This attitude shows a na\u00efve faith in the role of their secretaries. Indeed [*Emphasis*], young business people seldom have private secretaries. Similarly [*Comparison*], graduates taking up positions in technical or scientific fields may think that writing is something they seldom have to do. However [*Contrast*], our notion that only poets and novelists have to write is unrealistic. For example [*Illustration*], practising scientists and engineers say they spend half of their time writing papers and reports. Therefore[*Effect*], other things being equal, a person in any field who can express ideas clearly is sure to succeed."}
